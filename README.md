# Automated-Railway-Gate-Control-System
The objective is to design and develop automated railway gate control system. 
In conventional gate control system, the actuation of gate i.e closing of the gate and opening of the gate was done with respect to the distance from which the train is approaching towards the gate.
Distance factor was kept constant. By conventional method the 'waiting time' of vehicle and pedestrians was uncertain. 
The time taken by the train to cross the gate was variable.
With the 'Automated Railway Gate Control System' the time factor is kept constant and distance factor is kept variable.
So , the 'waiting time' at the gate is always constant irrespective of the speed and distance of the train traveled.
